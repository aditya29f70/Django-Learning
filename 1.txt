MVT -> model, view , template --> design pattern --> django follow that pattern

model= Data access layer
template= presentation layer
view -- businees logic

django documentation --> https://www.djangoproject.com/ vvimportant
repo --> https://github.com/Traversy-Media/StudyBud

django-admin gives all the fn can use with that

`django-admin startproject  project-name`

in StudyBud folder go and run --> `python manage.py runserver`

with running the server, do ==> python manage.py startapp
--> it will make a new file and i want to that our app would i
i has been generted so go --> setting.py --> go --> installed_app
and add put --> 'base.apps.BaseConfig'
and go app.py in 'base' and take 'BaseConfig(AppConfig)' class --> this is going to connect to the app directly

* we are now working on urls.py make use 'request' obj in a fn
the http request will be come through this 

so make a urls.py file in base also so that will be you app urls file
and that one urls.py file which in studybud --> root directly urls file

Note: studybud would we our main folder

# now adding templates so make template folder and tell settings.py
template that we have new templates folder

# inheritance templates by using % include 'navbar.html' %

# so rapping the content we will be using --> {% block content %} {$ endblock $}

# so you don't need to specify url as name basis eg--> /room/<str:pk> <== that is room.id
instead you can use --> "url 'name_of_url' room.id"

# now we are going to work on database;
